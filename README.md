## About

A simple CLI calculator written in C. Originally this lived in a private repo that contains the files for a 100 level C programming college course. However, this calculator is more feature rich than required by the course, so I feel comfortable making this public.
I wanted something I'd be happy with making quick calculations without leaving the terminal or having to start up a Python or Ruby REPL.

## How to use

- clone this repository
- navigate to cloned directory: `cd calculator`
- run app: `./calculator`
